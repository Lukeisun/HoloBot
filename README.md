# HoloBot!
***This is my first outside of class project that I've done, so please
be gentle if you're looking at the repo.***

## Description
HoloBot is a discord bot that scrapes the HTML of HoloLive members
youtube channel, which then ascertains if that user is live. Then sends
a message into a respective discord channel.

I hope that anybody who has an interest in HoloLive and runs a
discord would be using this bot.

My main goal of this project was twofold. For one, to get a
better understanding of how it feels to manage a project as well as
contributing to a community that shares an avid interest of mine!

## Instructions

I am still figuring out how to approach this, so please be patient!
